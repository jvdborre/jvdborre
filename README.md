### Hi there, I'm Joris ðŸ‘‹


I am founder of [Tropos][tropos.io] - a company which helps deliver end-to-end services for data analytics, data products and data platforms. We're 100% focused on using public cloud. Ask us about desining, building and operating business-first data analytics.

We were the first [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com) partner in Belgium, and one of the first in Europe. Ever since, we've been building practices, tools and methods to lower the entrance barrier to exciting analytics projects at scale.

In my day-to-day job, I run Tropos while in the late hours I still enjoy coding smaller POC's and pilots together with our team.
